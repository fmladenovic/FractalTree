üå≥üêç‚è≥ Fractal tree - Experimental comparing performances of python and golang (single thread, multi thread) and visualization with pharo, developed during the Advanced programming techniques </p>

## Definition
A *binary fractal tree* is defined recursively by symmetric binary branching. The trunk of given length splits into two branches of length r, each making an angle with the direction of trunk. Both of these branches divides into two branches of new length, each making an angle with direction of its parent branch. Continuing in this way for infinitely many branches, or in our case until branch don't shrink enough.

## Goal
The goal is to compare execution times of several implementations

 - First will be written in *python* with support of *multiprocessing* library.
 - Second will be written in *golang* with help of *gorutines*
 - Also, there will be recursive and object implementation
 - And *pharo* visualization.

## Requirements

*  [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-381/)

*  [Golang](https://golang.org/)

*  [Pharo](https://pharo.org/)
